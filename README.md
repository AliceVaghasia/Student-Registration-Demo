**Student Registration Demo**

A web-based application that allows students to register their information, store it securely in a MySQL database using JDBC, and view the registered details dynamically.

**🚀 Features :**
Student Registration Form: Users can input their details such as name, age, and course.
Data Validation: Ensures that all fields are filled out correctly before submission.
Database Connectivity: Utilizes JDBC to connect to a MySQL database for storing and retrieving student information.
Dynamic Data Display: Registered student details are displayed in a tabular format for easy viewing.

**🛠️ Technologies Used :**
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Backend: Java (JDBC)
Database: MySQL
Build Tool: Apache Maven
Server: Apache Tomcat

**✅ Conclusion :**

The Student Registration Demo project successfully demonstrates how a web-based interface can interact with a backend database to manage student information. Although this demo uses a simulated database for screenshots, the design and flow closely represent a real-world JDBC-based system.

**Key takeaways:**
Understanding the integration of HTML5 forms with a Java Servlet backend.
Demonstrating database operations (Insert, Read) via JDBC concepts.
Practicing project organization, including frontend, backend, and deployment configurations.
Building a visually appealing and interactive UI for user registration.
This project serves as a foundation for more complex applications involving full CRUD operations, authentication, and dynamic web development using Java and JDBC.
